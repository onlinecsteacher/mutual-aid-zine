                    <p class="interview-intro">We sat down with community organizer Jordan Rivera to talk about mutual aid, grassroots organizing, and how neighbors can show up for one another in meaningful ways.</p>

                        <h3>What inspired you to start Community Hands?</h3>
                        <p>"I realized that people in our neighborhood were struggling to meet basic needs, while others wanted to help but didn't know how. Mutual aid is about bridging that gap — not charity, but solidarity."</p>

                        <h3>Where do you see mutual aid heading in the next five years?</h3>
                        <p>"We're seeing a cultural shift. More people are realizing that systems aren't built to keep us safe, but communities can be. I think we'll see permanent networks of care — food distribution, housing support, and health resources — becoming part of everyday life."</p>

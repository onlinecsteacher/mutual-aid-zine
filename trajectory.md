In the folder zinemutualaid create two files, one called index.html and one called styles.css. Start out the index.html with a header and subheader and leave room for a nav bar on the top right. The header should read: The Power of Mutual Aid. The subheader should read: Building stronger communities through solidarity, care, and local action. The nav bar should have the following buttons: Home,	Get Involved, Donate

### Planner Response

### User Input

Add a section for an interview with a local activist. Put an image on the left and the following text to the right of the image: Supporting Each Other: A Conversation with Jordan Rivera
We sat down with community organizer Jordan Rivera to talk about mutual aid, grassroots organizing, and how neighbors can show up for one another in meaningful ways.
What inspired you to start Community Hands?
"I realized that people in our neighborhood were struggling to meet basic needs, while others wanted to help but didn’t know how. Mutual aid is about bridging that gap — not charity, but solidarity."
Where do you see mutual aid heading in the next five years?
"We’re seeing a cultural shift. More people are realizing that systems aren’t built to keep us safe, but communities can be. I think we’ll see permanent networks of care — food distribution, housing support, and health resources — becoming part of everyday life."
